# Animal Trading Card

<img src="example.png" alt="example of trading card design" width="100%" height="auto" />

This trading card design is the first project that I completed using code of any kind. It was certainly overkill for the given assignment, but I remember really enjoying the discovery process of learning how to create those complicated borders and icons. At this point, I didn't know anything about responsive web design, so please enjoy it in all its static glory.
